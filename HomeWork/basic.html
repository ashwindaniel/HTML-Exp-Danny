    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Global warming</b>, also referred to as <b>climate change</b>, is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects.Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system
        is warming.Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are <b>unprecedented</b> in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid-19th century, and in paleoclimate proxy records covering thousands of years.
    </p>
    <p> In 2013, the <b>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</b> Fifth Assessment Report concluded that <i>"It is extremely
            likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century"</i>. The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Climate
        model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century, the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further <strong>0.3 to 1.7 <sup>o</sup> C (0.5 to 3.1 <sup>o</sup>F)</strong> in the lowest emissions scenario,
        and <strong>2.6 to 4.8 <sup>o</sup>C (4.7 to 8.6 <sup>o</sup>F)</strong> in the highest emissions scenario. These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific
        body of national or international standing.

    <h2>Greenhouse Gases</h2>
    <p>The greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in a planet's atmosphere warm its lower atmosphere and surface. It was proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, discovered in 1860 by John Tyndall, was
        first investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896, and its scientific description was developed in the 1930s through 1960s by Guy Stewart Callendar.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Earth, an atmosphere containing naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases causes air temperature near the surface to be about 33 <sup>o</sup>C (59 <sup>o</sup>F) warmer than it would be in their absence. Without the Earth's atmosphere,
        the Earth's average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of water. The major greenhouse gases are <b>water vapour</b> which causes about 36–70% of the greenhouse effect, <b>carbon dioxide</b> (CO<sub>2</sub>) which causes 9–26%,
        <b>methane</b> (CH<sub>4</sub>) which causes 4–9%, and <b>ozone</b> (O<sub>3</sub>) which causes 3–7%. Clouds also affect the radiation balance through cloud forcings similar to greenhouse gases. </p>
    <p>
        <b>Human activity</b> since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from <b>CO<sub>2</sub>, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide.</b> According
        to work published in 2007, the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and methane had increased by 36% and 148% respectively since 1750. These levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years, the period for which reliable data
        has been extracted from ice cores. Less direct geological evidence indicates that CO<sub>2</sub> values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago.
